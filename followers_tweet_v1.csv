1266237312565784577 2020-05-29 06:17:55 BST <SandeepParekh> In academia - this is the very highest sin possible. You could write 'double murderer' in your profile and fellow academicians will not even blink. But even a possibility of plagiarism and they will treat you like a genocidal loon. 😃 https://twitter.com/chandrarsrikant/status/1266236149892177920 …
1264541004264333313 2020-05-24 13:57:24 BST <SandeepParekh> Intellectual @Ram_Guha tweets on 23rd May at 1248pm affirming the all new retraction of a retraction of a statement made by intellectual YoYa from 1240pm of 23rd. Without discussing his own retraction of a modified statement which was deleted. https://twitter.com/Ram_Guha/status/1264093365852712961?s=20 …
1264540457339621377 2020-05-24 13:55:13 BST <SandeepParekh> In the meanwhile, the original 412 pm version of 22nd May by Intellectual YoYa was retracted on 23rd May at 1240pm and another statement put up by Intellectual YoYa. https://twitter.com/_YogendraYadav/status/1264091192515366912?s=20 …
1264539563332186114 2020-05-24 13:51:40 BST <SandeepParekh> Now the Guha retraction of 1042am of 23rd May was deleted and thus presumably retracted. So the original, modified statement which was retracted, became retracted. Again.
1264539362429145092 2020-05-24 13:50:52 BST <SandeepParekh> This was retracted by Intellectual Guha @Ram_Guha  on 23rd May at 1042pm. pic.twitter.com/NgEtkF76hk
1264538447030767616 2020-05-24 13:47:14 BST <SandeepParekh> YoYa, a leading economic-intellectual-activist circulated a draft which was seen by 23 people who agreed to it. Then @_YogendraYadav the most intellectual in the group, circulated another draft which was published on 22nd May at 412pm. https://twitter.com/_YogendraYadav/status/1263782240514785280?s=20 …

1262986991156813825 2020-05-20 07:02:18 BST <SandeepParekh> What is it about Indians - they don't  want them to live like humans. Yes, even govt servants, can eat out, write poems, have a beer with friends, banter, open twitter accounts. Tax money paying for their 'job' doesn't mean they stop every activity that makes them human.

1260254539799764992 2020-05-12 18:04:31 BST <SandeepParekh> This is below Republic of Congo, Benin and Pakistan. This is a tough reform because the Supreme Court has arrogated to itself all powers with respect to the judiciary - making it unaccountable and inefficient. https://twitter.com/SandeepParekh/status/984645396822507521?s=20 …
1260254121283801090 2020-05-12 18:02:51 BST <SandeepParekh> While we are 63rd rank in overall score in ease of doing business (out of 190 countries - WorldBank), we rank 163rd for enforcement of contracts.
1260253479500763137 2020-05-12 18:00:18 BST <SandeepParekh> Legal reforms, if it means repealing most useless laws is not an achievement, though desirable. What is needed is a complete overhaul of the judiciary.
1260251257777852418 2020-05-12 17:51:28 BST <SandeepParekh> Land reforms are already underway in many states and need further push. Labour laws need a complete overhaul. We need a 5 page labour law - see previous tweets https://twitter.com/SandeepParekh/status/1258368668028854273?s=20 …
1260251154312814595 2020-05-12 17:51:04 BST <SandeepParekh> The current focus should be liquidity. Fill money in the dehydrated body of India. Liquidity is not food, but it is water for the body. Very very important in the short to medium term. Ability of MSMEs to pay their workers amongst many other things - will depend on this.
1260251027363725312 2020-05-12 17:50:33 BST <SandeepParekh> 4th On Land, labour, liquidity, laws reforms he has said exactly the right thing, though a bit late. I have tweeted about this - though those were immediate points for implementation. I can't give him any marks till I see reforms underway https://twitter.com/SandeepParekh/status/1254766489678143494?s=20 …
1260247055739555840 2020-05-12 17:34:47 BST <SandeepParekh> 3rd his 20 lac crore announcement was classic shock and awe   we see in Grey's Anatomy when they give defibrillator treatment to one whose heart has stopped. The economy needed it and he gave d right dose. I would give him 10/10  subject to some  bureaucrats translating it well
1260241874901700612 2020-05-12 17:14:11 BST <SandeepParekh> 2nd his make in India was a) politically good b) practically dependent on the reforms he mentioned c) hopefully was not a call for putting up import/export barriers (our wealth depends on the interdependence to a fair extent - Ricardo's theory of competetive advantage). 7to9/10
1260239958712991747 2020-05-12 17:06:34 BST <SandeepParekh> 1st Connected to his base very effectively - while people were  too eager to come to the point (read upper middle class) - he took his time to use his powerful oratory and skillful use of Hindi to connect. So 10/10 on communication and political messaging. https://twitter.com/PMOIndia/status/1260216479049367552?s=20 …
1260239811123781635 2020-05-12 17:05:59 BST <SandeepParekh> So what did I think of the @narendramodi speech today? Thread.

1259534465426210816 2020-05-10 18:23:12 BST <SandeepParekh> Yup. People like to walk 1200 kms non stop because they are training for marathon for next year’s Olympics. 😳🙄 https://twitter.com/AninditaAdhik13/status/1259430764766212096 …
1258368668028854273 2020-05-07 13:10:44 BST <SandeepParekh> Do we know that India has 17 definitions of 'workers', 22 definitions of 'wages', and 72 central laws to comply with? We try to be great at job preservation - thereby completely failing at job creation. We have been perpetual enemies of productivity. India has thrived inspite of
1258033689411403776 2020-05-06 14:59:39 BST <SandeepParekh> This is the time for throwing d kitchen sink at the problem, not give lectures about 'no free lunches'. We should be looking at a massive fiscal stimulus and liquidity support - the quantum of which would be seen as irrational in rational times. This is the time for unltd support
